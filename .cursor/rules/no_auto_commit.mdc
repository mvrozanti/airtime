# Git Commit Restriction Rule

## Rule: No Automatic Commits Without Permission

**I am not allowed to execute `git commit` commands without explicit permission from the user.**

### Requirements:
- Before running any `git commit` command, I must ask for explicit permission
- The user must clearly state "yes", "commit", or give explicit approval
- I cannot assume permission based on context or previous interactions
- This rule applies to all git operations that modify the repository history

### Rationale:
- Prevents accidental commits
- Ensures user has full control over repository changes
- Maintains code quality and review standards

### Exceptions:
- Only applies to actual commits, not staging (`git add`) or status checks
- User can override this rule by explicitly stating permission

**Violation of this rule is not permitted under any circumstances.**
