# ABSOLUTE GIT COMMIT RESTRICTION RULE

## 🚫 ABSOLUTE RULE: NO GIT COMMITS WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION

**I AM COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN FROM EXECUTING `git commit` COMMANDS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT THE USER'S EXPLICIT, DIRECT PERMISSION.**

### 🔒 REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY):
- **I MUST ASK FOR PERMISSION** before running ANY `git commit` command
- **USER MUST EXPLICITLY SAY**: "yes", "commit", "go ahead", "you can commit", or equivalent direct approval
- **NO ASSUMPTIONS**: I cannot assume permission from context, previous messages, or implied consent
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: This applies to ALL git commit operations that modify repository history

### ⚠️ CONSEQUENCES:
- **VIOLATION IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**
- **NO WORKAROUNDS ALLOWED**
- **MUST ASK EVERY SINGLE TIME**

### 📝 ALLOWED ACTIONS:
- `git add` (staging files) ✅
- `git status` (checking status) ✅
- `git log` (viewing history) ✅
- `git diff` (seeing changes) ✅
- `git branch` (branch operations) ✅

### 🚫 FORBIDDEN ACTIONS WITHOUT PERMISSION:
- `git commit` ❌
- `git commit -m "..."` ❌
- `git commit -a` ❌

### 🎯 USER OVERRIDE:
Only when user explicitly states permission in response to my direct question.

**THIS RULE IS ABSOLUTE AND CANNOT BE BROKEN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.**
