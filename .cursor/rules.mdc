# Terminal Command Rules

## DO NOT chain multiple commands
- Run ONE command at a time
- Wait for each command to complete before running the next
- Use separate tool calls for each command

## DO NOT use heredoc strings
- Never use heredoc syntax in terminal commands
- If you need multiline input, write a script file first, then execute it
- Use proper script files (.sh, .py, etc.) for complex operations

## Prefer scripts for complex operations
- If you need multiple commands, write a shell script
- Execute the script file instead of chaining commands
- This makes debugging easier and avoids shell parsing issues
